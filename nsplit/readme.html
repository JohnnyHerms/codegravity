        <h2>Upsss! It looks like I am not allowed to start a HTTP server here.</h2>
        <p>
            This application listens to http://localhost:8080/. By default, listening at a particular HTTP address requires administrator privileges. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When you run me, therefore, you may get this error: &quot;HTTP could not register URL <a href="http://+:8080/">http://+:8080/</a>&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways to avoid this error:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run Visual Studio with elevated administrator permissions (right click and <i><b>&quot;Run as Administrator&quot;</b></i>), or</li>
            <li>Use Netsh.exe to give your account permissions to reserve the URL.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To use Netsh.exe, open a command prompt with administrator privileges and enter the following command:following command:
        </p>
        <pre><span>netsh http add urlacl url = http:/+:8080/ user=machine\username</span></pre>
        <p >
            When you are finished self-hosting, be sure to delete the reservation:
        </p>
        <pre>//+:8080/</pre>
